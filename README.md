# What is this?

This is a basic alyout for discord bot creation in JS. 
There's no real commands here but the outline is there when I decide to make a new bot.

It's mostly for testing and implemenation of new mechanices added since my last code rewrite

Discord is an online messaging platform that you can find more about in [here](https://discord.com).
